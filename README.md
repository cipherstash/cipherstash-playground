# CipherStash Playground

This is a playground to demonstate the capabilities of CipherStash and how it can be used to secure data that is stored in a database and other data stores.

CipherStash leverages encryption in use to provide a secure and auditable way to store and access data.
We leveage searchable encryption to maintain application functionality while keeping data encrypted, not just at rest or in transit, but also in use.

One of the ways we differentiate CipherStash from other encryption solutions is through a zero trust key management model.
You can read more about our zero trust key management conecpts [here](https://cipherstash.com/docs/concepts/zero-trust-key-management).
